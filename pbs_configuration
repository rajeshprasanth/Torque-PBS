===============
Installation
===============

sudo apt-get install torque-server torque-client torque-mom torque-pam

Configuration
=============

1. Stop all services runnings

sudo service torque-server stop
sudo service torque-scheduler stop
sudo service torque-mom stop


****for starting the services use this****
sudo service torque-server start
sudo service torque-scheduler start
sudo service torque-mom start



2. Start pbs_server is create mode

sudo pbs_server -t create

if prompt as you to accept the config. hit yes
note down hostname and domain name

3. kill just invoked pbs_server

sudo killall pbs_server

4. Run this command for configuration.

echo SERVER.DOMAIN > /etc/torque/server_name
echo SERVER.DOMAIN > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/acl_hosts
echo root@SERVER.DOMAIN > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/operators
echo root@SERVER.DOMAIN > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/managers
echo "SERVER.DOMAIN np=4" > /var/spool/torque/server_pr
echo SERVER.DOMAIN > /var/spool/torque/mom_priv/config


====for example============
echo ubuntu.ubuntu-domain > /etc/torque/server_name
echo ubuntu.ubuntu-domain > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/acl_hosts
echo root@ubuntu.ubuntu-domain > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/operators
echo root@ubuntu.ubuntu-domain > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/managers

echo root@localhost > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/operators
echo root@localhost > /var/spool/torque/server_priv/acl_svr/managers


5. Start the services in this order.

sudo service torque-server start
sudo service torque-scheduler start
sudo service torque-mom start

use this command to find logs caused due to unauthorized entries
grep Unauthorized /var/spool/torque/server_logs/*


qmgr -c 'create queue batch'
qmgr -c 'set server scheduling = true'
qmgr -c 'set server keep_completed = 300'
qmgr -c 'set server mom_job_sync = true'
qmgr -c 'set queue batch queue_type = execution'
qmgr -c 'set queue batch started = true'
qmgr -c 'set queue batch enabled = true'
qmgr -c 'set queue batch resources_default.walltime = 5:00:00'
qmgr -c 'set queue batch resources_default.nodes = 1'
qmgr -c 'set server default_queue = batch'
qmgr -c 'set server submit_hosts = SERVER'
qmgr -c 'set server allow_node_submit = true'




==================================PBS Commands===============================

===========
qsub---To submit a batch job to the specified queue using a script:
==========

%qsub -q queue_name job_script 

Queue names on Pleiades include normal, debug, long, devel, and low. When queue_name is omitted, the job is routed to the default queue, which is the normal queue.

To submit an interactive PBS job:

%qsub -I -q queue_name -l resource_list 

No job_script should be included when submitting an interactive PBS job.

The resource_list typically specifies the number of nodes, CPUs, amount of memory and wall time needed for this job. The following example shows a request for a single Pleiades Ivy Bridge node and a wall time of 2 hours.

%qsub -I -lselect=1:ncpus=20:model=ivy,walltime=2:00:00

See man pbs_resources for more information on what resources can be specified.

Note: If -l resource_list is omitted, the default resources for the specified queue is used. When queue_name is omitted, the job is routed to the default queue, which is the normal queue.
qstat

To display queue information:

%qstat -Q queue_name
%qstat -q queue_name
%qstat -fQ queue_name 

Each option uses a different format to display all of the queues available, and their constraints and status. The queue_name is optional.

To display job status:

-a
    Display all jobs in any status (running, queued, held)
-r
    Display all running or suspended jobs
-n
    Display the execution hosts of the running jobs
-i
    Display all queued, held or waiting jobs
-u username
    Display jobs that belong to the specified user
-s
    Display any comment added by the administrator or scheduler. This option is typically used to find clues of why a job has not started running.
-f job_id
    Display detailed information about a specific job
-xf job_id,
-xu user_id
    Display status information for finished jobs (within the past 7 days). This option is only available in the newer version of PBS, which has been installed on Pleiades and Endeavour.

TIP: Some of these flags can be combined when you are checking the job status.
qdel

To delete (cancel) a job:

%qdel job_id 

qhold

To hold a job:

%qhold job_id 

Only the job owner or a system administrator with "su" or "root" privilege can place a hold on a job. The hold can be released using the qrls command.

For more detailed information on each command, see their corresponding man pages.
